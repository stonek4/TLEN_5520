Data was captured on March 12, 2017 beginning at 3:50 PM.  It was very busy when I went because it was both a weekend and there was the St. Patrick's Day parade.  Obviously there was a ton of congestion on this channel.  The vast majority of packets were beacons which clogged up the channel with slow 1Mb/s messages and didn't allow anything else to send. I also found it interesting that for every probe request there were tons of probe responses since there were so many access points close together but not working together.
