First I set up my laptop and then scanned for access points in the area.  I recorded my data at Pearl Street, and it was very busy.  The following is my setup and a picture from a wifi scanner on my phone. Listing wlans on my computer showed over 80 (on all frequencies).

I decided to scan on channel 1 since it seemed the most busy.  I recorded just over 10,000 packets, and then created the charts as requested below.

Data was captured on March 12, 2017 beginning at 3:50 PM.  It was very busy when I went because it was both a weekend and there was the St. Patrick's Day parade.  Obviously there was a ton of congestion on this channel.  The vast majority of packets were beacons which clogged up the channel with slow 1Mb/s messages and didn't allow anything else to send. I also found it interesting that for every probe request there were tons of probe responses since there were so many access points close together but not working together.
